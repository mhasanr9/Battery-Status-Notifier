# Laptop Battery Management and Lifespan

Charging a laptop battery beyond 100% over an extended period of time may lead to a reduction in battery life. Most laptops do not provide a warning when the battery reaches 100%, resulting in trickle charging that further reduces the battery's lifespan. 

Third-party batteries can exacerbate this issue as they often lack a high-quality Battery Management System (BMS) chip to regulate charging effectively.

## Python Program to Prevent Overcharging

This simple Python program runs in the background and alerts you to unplug your charger when the battery reaches 90%. Here's how you can use it:

1. **Place the EXE File**: 
   - Place the executable file anywhere in your `C:\` drive.
   
2. **Set Up Task Scheduler**:
   - Create a basic task in Task Scheduler to start the program automatically at login.

This setup helps protect your battery and prolong its lifespan.
